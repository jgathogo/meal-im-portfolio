The programme distributed 6,461 Buffalo Bicycles to students, community health workers, conservation volunteers, and livelihood groups to reduce travel barriers to education, healthcare, economic activity, and environmental protection.\nTheory of change: If individuals and communities experiencing mobility poverty gain sustained access to appropriate bicycle mobility, and if this access is supported by local governance, maintenance systems, trained mechanics, and spare-parts availability, then they can reduce travel time, physical effort, and travel-related risk, enabling more consistent participation in education, livelihoods, service delivery, and environmental action.",
